Same hygiene, far less water.\n- Teeth: Don\u2019t run the tap. Use a small cup (150\u2013250 ml) to wet and rinse.\n- Shaving: Fill the basin with a little warm water to rinse the razor instead of running water.\n- Face and quick wash-ups: Use a damp washcloth or a small basin of water rather than a flowing tap.\n- Towels: Hang them to dry fully (like yours) and reuse several times before laundering.\n\nShowers (biggest savings)\n- Aim for 3\u20135 minutes. Try a \u201cnavy shower\u201d: wet, water off to soap/shampoo, water on to rinse.\n- Catch the cold \u201cwarm\u2011up\u201d water in a bucket; use it for cleaning or flushing where allowed.\n- Choose a 1.5\u20132.0 gpm low\u2011flow showerhead; it feels good but cuts water use dramatically.\n\nSink upgrades and checks\n- Install a faucet aerator (0.5\u20131.0 gpm) on this sink; it\u2019s cheap and saves water without feeling weak.\n- Fix drips promptly; check under the sink for slow leaks.\n- Keep a cup by the toothbrush to remind you not to run the tap.\n\nLaundry and cleaning\n- Reuse towels and clothing sensibly to reduce wash frequency; wash full loads with cold water.\n- For surface cleaning, use spray-and-wipe methods instead of rinsing with lots of water.\n\nWhen water is very limited\n- Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer when hands aren\u2019t visibly dirty; wash with soap and water when they are.\n- Do a \u201csponge bath\u201d with a small basin and washcloth.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll save (roughly)\n- Turning off the tap while brushing/shaving: 2\u20134 liters per minute avoided.\n- Aerator: up to 50% less sink water.\n- 5-minute low\u2011flow shower: about 35\u201350% less than a typical shower; far less than a bath.\n\nLow-cost shopping list: 0.5\u20131.0 gpm faucet aerator, 1.5\u20132.0 gpm showerhead, small cup for rinsing, bucket, and a simple shower timer.",

This cuts use by more than half.\n- Install sink aerators (0.35\u20130.5 gpm vs. 1.5\u20132.2 gpm).\n\nShowers/bathing\n- \u201cNavy shower\u201d: 30-second wet, water off to soap/shampoo, 60\u201390-second rinse.\n- Fit a low-flow showerhead (\u22641.5\u20132.0 gpm).\n- Collect warm-up water in a bucket; reuse for toilet flushing or cleaning.\n\nTeeth and shaving\n- Teeth: use a cup to rinse; keep tap off.\n- Shaving: fill the sink with a few centimeters of water instead of running the tap.\n\nToilets\n- Use dual-flush or high-efficiency models; if acceptable, \u201cif it\u2019s yellow, let it mellow.\u201d\n- Drop a filled bottle or displacement bag in older toilet tanks to reduce volume (ensure proper flushing).\n- Reuse greywater (from handwashing/shower) for flushing; don\u2019t store more than 24 hours.\n\nLaundry and dishes\n- Run full loads; choose eco/quick cycles and cold water when possible.\n- For hand-washing dishes: scrape instead of pre-rinsing; use two basins (wash, then rinse) instead of running water. Dishwashers typically use less water than hand-washing if fully loaded.\n\nFacility tips (if you can influence the space)\n- Report leaks immediately; a dripping tap can waste liters per day.\n- Install sensor or foot-pedal taps, low-flow fixtures, and auto-shutoff valves.\n- Post quick reminders near sinks about the scrub-with-tap-off method.\n\nNote for this room\n- Keep open water and wet cleaning away from electrical/server equipment; use alcohol hand sanitizer outside the server room and closed-lid containers for any cleaning water.\n\nLow-water contingencies\n- Use hand sanitizer and disposable wipes for short periods when water is scarce (dispose of wipes in trash, not toilets).\n\nThese habits maintain good hygiene while significantly cutting water use.",
